      <p>
        I'm a recent bachelor's graduate with profound knowledge of software
        development, data structure and design, networking, professional
        programming practice, documentation, UI/UX design, human-computer
        interaction, ethics, and consumer behaviour. Project experience in java,
        web and mobile application development, testing, debugging and
        documentation. I've always been interested in computer science since my
        childhood and have been developing my programming skills since high
        school. Besides that, I like water sports and exploring the outdoors.
